# Project-1-Group-6
Data Analytics Bootcamp: Project 1

Group 6

Project Ideas:

Lailah: Using: statcan.gc.ca (CPI), https://api.canada.ca/en/homepage




Zac: Using: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-census.html for Calfornia (or all states??)

How has the population density of counties changed over time (2000-2020)?
Do low popden countiesâ€™ pop increase at a relatively high rate vs. high popden counties?
Categorize counties based on low, high popdensity
Population increase from 2000 to 2020 based on initial popdensity bin (correlations: low initial popdensity correlates with high rate of population increase? vice-versa)

Has salary in low pop. density counties increased at a relatively high rate versus salary in high pop. density counties from 2000 to 2020?
Versus High popden counties, do Low popden counties have a relatively low avg. salary? Median salary?

Discussion/Future Research:
How does affordability factor in?




Include:
Heat map style plot for pop. increase rates by county over period 2000-2020
Heat map style plot for average salary by county over period 2000-2020
Also, scatterplot with unique markers based on popdensity bin (very low = triangle, etc.)
Heat map style plot for median salary by county over period 2000-2020
Also, scatterplot with unique markers based on popdensity bin (very low = triangle, etc.)
Bar graph of population by county by year (2000, 2010, 2020) grouped by 2000 popdensity bin (very low, low, medium, high, very high)
Bar graph of population change rate (pop change / years) by county (2010 and 2020) by popdensity bin
