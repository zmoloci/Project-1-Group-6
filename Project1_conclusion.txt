1. Population in New York state is not evenly distributed. According to the latest census in 2020, over 50% of its population is concentrated in
6 out of the 62 counties.  Kings County-13.54%, Queens County-11.91%, New York County-8.39%, Suffolk County-7.55%, Bronx County-7.29%, 
& Nassau County-6.91%.

2. According to growth rate percentage results that is common throughout New York state, the r value is just with a range of -0.5 to -0.6.
This tells us that there is a negative (or inverse) relationship between growth rates of population density & per capita income.  As
the population increases, we could say that per capita income growth decreases.  However, this is not the case for Saratoga County, which
has the highest population growth rate.  The r value is 0.97, which means that there is a positive (or direct) relationship between the
variables.  This could possibly explain why people are moving to this County.  There are a number of factors that could affect this, which
are not covered in this research.  As we all know, more population means more business.  There could also be a massive inflow of investments
in this area.

3. As per the chart results comparing 1970 Population density versus 2020 Per Capita income, it gave us an r value of 0.62. Meaning, there is a medium 
direct or positive relationship between 2020 per capita incoe & 1970 population density. In other words, Counties with higher population density in
1970 tend to have higher per capita income in 2020.
